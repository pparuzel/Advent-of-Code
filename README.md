# Advent-of-Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly event for problem solvers where each day a new puzzle is released in two parts. The first part is simple and the second one more complex.

In this repository you can explore my approaches to finding the solution.

## My rules

- **Zero AI** assistance [^1].
- Strive for the **most elegant**, cleanest solution possible.
- Attempt to solve it the **same day** [^2].
- Preferrably **avoid** using **the internet** all together [^3].
- **No hints** [^4].
- Complexity-shmexity. If I got the result - I passed.

[^1]: Otherwise I do not see the point to the challenge.
[^2]: Depending on how busy I am. I will try.
[^3]: Maybe language docs sometimes, that's it.
[^4]: Unless it's the next day, I failed miserably earlier and I am weeping in the corner.
